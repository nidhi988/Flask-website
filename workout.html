<h2>Upper Body Workout</h2>
<p>1.Overhead Press( Dumbbell press)</p>
<p>It is a compound exercise that involves lifting a weighted barbell overhead to a fully locked out position with the strict use of the shoulders and arms.</p>
<p>Pressing the bar overhead is one of the most useful upper body exercise you can do.This highly active involves the entire body. Your feet, legs, glutes, core, abs, hips, ankles and wrists help to stabilise the body whilst your shoulders, upper chest, arms press the bar overhead.</p>

<h3>2.Bench press</h3>
<p>Bench press is a great way to build power and improve lockout strength and overhead press movements for other lifts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lie on a flat bench with your eyes under the bar. Lift your chest and squeeze your shoulder blades</li>
<li>
Hold the bar in the base of your palm with straigh wrists and full grip</li>
<li>
Take full breath and unrack the bar by straightening your arms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Barbell Row</h3>
<p>The barbell row will improve the strength of your back, hips and grip and is even useful for improving the power of your pull-ups and muscle ups.</p>
<p>The barbell row is not only a back or upper body exercise. When you are unracking the box and setting your stance, you will bend at waist and the glutes, hamstrings and hips will work together to stabilise your body even before you have even completed the first pull.</p>

<h3>4.Dips</h3>
<p>Dips are a stable compound exercise in many athletes routines. This requires great strength and range of motion.The biggest mistake in dips is letting the shoulder move too forward as you go down. This put huge stress on shoulder joints and muscles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Start in the support position with the elbows locked. Initiate dip by sending the shoulder joint and muscles.</li>
<li>
Reach the bottom of the dip with shoulder below the elbow. Press back up and finish in the same strong support position in which you started.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lower Body workout</h2>
<h3>1.Squat</h3>
<p>Squats primarily works the glutes, the squat engages every muscle from the floor through to the small  of the back. That doesn't make it easy to avoid doing all the wrong. To perfect the squat, place your knees shoulder-width apart, keep your back straight and drop your hips until they are parallel with your knees.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself dropping into a chair. Once you're parallel push off the floor, keeping your knees over your toes and driving hips forward.</p>

<h3>2.Lunge</h3>
<p>Very few exercises work for lower body stability quite like the lunge. Start with feet shoulder-width apart.</p>
<p>Take a step forward, dropping your hips until both knees are parallel with the hips, quad perpendicular to the shens. Push off with your forward foot and return to the original position, or bring the back leg parallel with the front. Repeat the action with other leg.</p>

<h3>3.Deadlift</h3>
<p>To perform the deadlift, grip the weight on the floor, with feet-hip-width apart. Keeping your back absolutely straight, push through the floor with your feet, rising with the weight until you're standing tall with the weight at waist level</p>
<p>As your strength improves, your lower body will eventually outpace your grip strength; if you are using olympic barbell or letting the weight hang after your last rep as a negative rep for your forearms.</p>

<h3>4.Bulgarian split squat</h3>
<p>For the next level strength and stability, try the bulgarian split squat. Place the top of one foot on the bench, then lower your knees and hips until the hips are parallel with the front knee. Push through the back heel to return to the original position.</p>
